# CV to StreetFighter

The goal of this project is to use pose estimation models (e.g., ViT-Pose, MediaPipe, or OpenPose) to detect human movements and map them to Street Fighter character actions.
 
By capturing player poses through a webcam, the system recognizes actions such as:

üëä Punch

ü¶∂ Kick

üôÖ Block

üï∫ Movement (left/right/jump/crouch)

These inputs are then fed into a custom PyGame environment that controls Street Fighter gameplay.

## Set Up and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/StreetFighter-PoseController.git
cd StreetFighter-PoseController

conda create -n StreetFighter python=3.12
conda activate StreetFighter
```

## Requirements
```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenG
```
